# 【やる「遣る」】vs 【する「為る」】

やる「遣る」 と する「為る」 はどう違いますか？説明が難しい場合は、例文を教えて下さい。

---

First of all, the Kanji 遣る means to send someone to somewhere. For example, 使いに遣る, so you don't want to use Kanji when you use the verb meaning the same as する.  
Kanji 為る is not popular either. Most of the time they are both written in Hiragana.  
  
やる sounds more casual/informal than する. You should be careful not to use it when you write or speak formally.

So besides formal/casual, they are interchangeable right?

---

Yes, they are. As long as you are speaking casually, you can use both as you like.
