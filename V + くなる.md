I was talking to a person and they used:

> 大切にしたくなるよ。

Does that mean I have come to cherish or something like that?

> Does that mean I have come to cherish or something like that?

Yes, that is precisely the idea!

Now, a grammar explanation...

「なる」 here means "***to reach a certain (new) state***" and you will keep encountering this usage of the word as long as you study Japanese. That is a promise from a native speaker.

> 「連用形れんようけい (continuative form) + なる」＝ "to become ~~", "to start doing ~~", etc.

「たく」 is the 連用形 of the subsidiary verb 「たい」("to want to"); therefore, 「～～したくなる」 means "to start wanting to ~~". (「し」 is the 連用形 of「する」)

「赤あかくなる」 = "to turn red". 「赤く」 is the 連用形 of 「赤い」.

「パリに行いきたくなった。」 = "I have started wanting to go to Paris."

But since you need the verb form to end in い, how do you use this is non-past verbs? I assume this is correct: りんごを食べたくなった (I started wanting to eat apples) りんごを食べなくなった (I started not eating apples) (So, from now on, I'm not eating apples anymore) My tries: (I started eating apples) (So, from now on, I'm eating apples) りんごを食べになった。 りんごを食べるのようになった Thanks! – kuonb Jan 19 '16 at 8:59


@kuonb You don't need the verb form to end in い; you need it to be the continuative stem (連用形) of the verb in question. The continuative often ends in い, but not always. Monograde verbs like 食べる have continuatives that end in whatever vowel the stem of the root itself ends in (for 食べる, that's -e: 食べ). So the corresponding form with 食べる is simply 食べ+なる. Whether 「りんごを食べなった」 is something any Japanese speaker would ever say is an entirely different matter, to which I don't know the answer. – Janus Bahs Jacquet Nov 26 '16 at 12:15
